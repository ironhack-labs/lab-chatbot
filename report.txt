Report on Chatbot Performance and Findings

1. Summary of Chatbot Interactions

	•	Furry Ball Bot (Version 1):
	•	Interaction: The bot responded promptly and politely, guiding the user through the steps of making an appointment for a pet grooming service.
	•	Strengths: Clear and structured conversation flow, appropriate clarification of available services, and effective handling of user responses.
	•	Weaknesses: Minor spelling error in the user’s input (“ppointment”) didn’t cause issues, but there’s room for improvement in handling 
    misspellings gracefully.
	•	Sushi Bot (Version 2):
	•	Interaction: The bot efficiently guided the user through the ordering process, provided menu details, and managed the dining preference.
	•	Strengths: Comprehensive response to inquiries about menu items and clear follow-up questions to confirm order details.
	•	Weaknesses: There was confusion during the dine-in confirmation step, as the bot mistakenly asked for a delivery address even after the user 
    specified dining in.
	•	Adventure Bot (Version 3):
	•	Interaction: The bot handled the holiday booking process well, offering detailed options and providing a discount for a larger group.
	•	Strengths: Good at presenting holiday package options, performing price calculations, and applying group discounts.
	•	Weaknesses: Slight issues in natural language interpretation, such as repeating the need for contact details without a smooth transition, 
    could be improved.

2. Analysis of Variations and Errors

	•	Hallucinations and Confusion:
	•	In Version 2 (Sushi Bot), the bot exhibited some confusion when it asked for a delivery address after the user explicitly stated that they were dining in. 
    This indicates a logic gap where the bot didn’t fully adapt to the user’s response.
	•	The other versions did not experience significant hallucinations, but all bots can benefit from enhanced handling of user input errors and more natural 
    language processing for a smoother conversation.
	•	Handling User Input Variations:
	•	Across all versions, the bots handled variations in user input relatively well. 
    They provided appropriate responses even when the input deviated slightly from expected formats.
	•	The conversation flow was mostly maintained, with only minor issues in understanding or miscommunication in specific cases.

3. Lessons Learned

	•	Importance of Robust Error Handling: Effective error handling is crucial, as it directly impacts the user experience. For instance, 
    the Sushi Bot could improve by better recognizing context (e.g., differentiating between dine-in and delivery scenarios).
	•	Need for Context Awareness: The chatbots need to maintain context more effectively to avoid asking irrelevant questions 
    or making incorrect assumptions based on user input.
	•	User-Friendly Experience: Despite minor issues, the bots overall provided a user-friendly experience, 
    guiding users through complex tasks like holiday bookings and grooming appointments. Customizing the tone and responses to match user expectations 
    enhanced the interaction.

Conclusion

Overall, the bots performed well in guiding users through their respective tasks, though there are opportunities to refine their logic and context management. 
Improving these aspects would make the​ bot more effective and user-friendly.
